# Iowa Technology Club Website

Welcome to the Iowa Technology Club website repository! This project powers the official site of our club, showcasing our achievements, members, and projects. If you're looking to understand how the website works or want to contribute, you've come to the right place.

## Project Overview

The website is built using HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and TailwindCSS. The content on the site is dynamically rendered by passing JSON objects to the JavaScript files, which then display the appropriate information on the site.

### Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: Structure of the website.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Handles dynamic content rendering.
- **TailwindCSS**: Provides a responsive and modern design.

## Directory Structure

- `index.html`: The main file that ties everything together.
- `JSON/`: This directory contains all the JSON files used to store the content displayed on the website.

## How It Works

The website's content is managed through JSON files located in the `JSON/` directory. These JSON files include information about members, achievements, projects, and more. When the website loads, the JavaScript fetches this data and displays it on the relevant sections of the site.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to improve the website! You can contribute by modifying the JSON files to update or add content. Here’s how you can do it:

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine.
3. **Navigate to the `JSON/` directory** and edit the relevant JSON file to:
   - Add yourself as a member.
   - Add an achievement.
   - Add a project.
   - Make any other necessary changes.
4. **Commit your changes** and push them to your fork.
5. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** to propose your changes to this repository.

Once your PR is reviewed and approved, your changes will be merged, and the website will be updated accordingly.
